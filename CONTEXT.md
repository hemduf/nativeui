# NativeUI compact recovery context

**Updated:** 2026-09-07

## Mission and architecture

NativeUI is a generic C++20 retained-mode UI toolkit for standalone applications and embedded/plugin views. It owns declarative composition, component lifetime, layout, input/focus, generic state/binding, drawing/widgets, text editing, styling/invalidation/resources, packaging and tests. It does **not** own plugin APIs, audio/DSP, host parameter semantics or a custom native windowing layer.

```

- Windowing/embedding: Pugl.
- Rendering: Skia Ganesh/OpenGL plus headless Skia raster rendering.
- Third-party acquisition: CMake + CPM only.
- Public coordinates are logical pixels; native geometry/framebuffer is physical pixels.
- Widgets/layout stay platform-neutral and do not include Pugl/Win32/AppKit/Xlib headers.

## Pinned dependencies

- Pugl: `lv2/pugl` commit `b7637149ebe53124e5be90559e02a0185bbcbd73`.
- Skia: `olilarkin/skia-builder` release `chrome/m149`.
- macOS Skia asset: `skia-build-mac-universal-gpu-release.zip`.
- Windows: x64 MSVC `/MD` default, `/MT` selectable.
- Linux: x64 GPU release.

## Implemented baseline

Core/runtime includes observable `State<T>`, declarative DSL/runtime component tree, Row/Column/Stack/Padding/Spacer, constraints/alignment/flex/Grid/Scroll layout, clipping/transforms, focus scopes/traversal, logical pointer routing and toolkit pointer capture, command/gesture/drop primitives, bounded invalidation, generic Painter/Canvas, and headless/golden rendering support.

Text/widgets include Header, Label/TextLabel, Knob, Toggle, TextInput, TextEditModel and interactive Canvas. T027 adds a platform-neutral font service with named family/weight/slant, embedded font aliases, ordered explicit fallback families and platform Unicode fallback. Measurement and painting share the same UTF-8 resolved-run path.

Windowing uses `StandaloneWindow` (`PUGL_PROGRAM`) and `EmbeddedView` (`PUGL_MODULE`), with non-blocking embedded polling, resize support, clipboard bridging and GL resource lifetime constrained to an active Pugl GL context.

Every feature ticket must ship `examples/features/tNNN_<feature>.cpp` with interactive mode and `--self-test`; feature sources also compile against `NativeUI::Core` in display-less CI.

## Current sequential status

Strict sequencing from `AGENTS.md` is mandatory.

- Last completed ticket: **T027 — font manager/fallback abstraction**.
- PR #55 final head `51564ab84f8c6a31c1165ac0904ad30f902916c3` passed GitHub Actions run #33 on Linux X11, Windows/MSVC, macOS and Linux ASan+UBSan.
- PR #55 was squash-merged to `main` as `e18c5238257d8a1505b062c8afa711e11d47a36d` only after that matrix was green.
- Issue #27 is closed as completed with `status:done`.
- Required T027 review passes A/B/C are complete.
- Next sequential ticket: **T028 — Add multiline TextArea**. No T028 implementation existed at the T027 merge point.
- T041 exists ahead of sequence and must not be used to skip T028–T040.

## T027 implementation and portability notes

- `TextStyle` adds `family`, `fallback_families`, `FontSlant`, and numeric Skia-compatible weights.
- `FontManager` is public and platform-neutral; CoreText/DirectWrite/Fontconfig construction remains private in `src/skia_core.cpp`.
- Embedded font registration owns/copies bytes and publishes immutable registry snapshots; normal measure/paint reads do not acquire the registration mutex.
- Resolution per Unicode scalar: explicit primary -> ordered explicit fallbacks -> platform Unicode fallback -> best `.notdef` face.
- Adjacent scalars using the same face are grouped into UTF-8 runs; `TextService::measure()` and `Painter::text()` share the resolver.
- Deterministic tiny test fonts prove primary `A` and fallback `Ω`/`日` selection, mixed-run measurement and painting.
- UBSan `vptr` alone is disabled at the pinned prebuilt Skia ABI boundary; ASan and remaining UBSan checks stay enabled.
- Linux LSan keeps `detect_leaks=1`; only Fontconfig's process-lifetime `FcFontRenderPrepare` allocation path is suppressed.
- Windows CI explicitly uses MSVC to match `Skia.lib`; `NOMINMAX` prevents Win32 macro pollution.
- macOS uses the universal Skia artifact on `macos-15-intel`.
- Xcode 16.4 libc++ portability is handled by using `std::atomic<std::shared_ptr<T>>` only when supported, otherwise the standard shared_ptr atomic load/store API.

## Current limitations / next work

- T028/T029 still need multiline text/TextArea and advanced IME composition work.
- Standard Button/Slider/ComboBox/List/ScrollView/Tabs/Menu widgets remain later milestones.
- Theme/style inheritance, accessibility, Wayland, packaging/install/export and full host integration remain incomplete.

## Build commands

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build -j
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
./build/nativeui_demo
```

Offline dependency overrides:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build \
  -DNATIVEUI_PUGL_SOURCE=/path/to/pugl \
  -DNATIVEUI_SKIA_ROOT=/path/to/extracted/skia-builder
```

## Non-negotiable invariants

- no plugin parameter/audio semantics in NativeUI;
- no SDL/GLFW/Qt/JUCE/NanoVG;
- widgets never depend on Pugl/Win32/AppKit/Xlib;
- Pugl remains the native view/event layer;
- Skia remains the renderer and comes from pinned skia-builder binaries;
- dependencies stay CMake + CPM;
- a normal new widget must not require a central component enum/switch.

## Pugl reject-offer portability note

Pinned Pugl declares `puglRejectOffer()` but only X11 defines it. Portable NativeUI code must use `reject_pugl_drop_offer()` in `pugl_skia_setup.inc`: X11 rejects explicitly; macOS/Windows rely on native unaccepted-offer semantics.
